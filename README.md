Financial institutions face significant challenges in post-trade reconciliation,  matching internal trade records with external data,  due to high volumes, complex data formats, and strict regulatory deadlines. Manual exception handling is error-prone and time-consuming, leading to inconsistencies that can result in financial misstatements or regulatory penalties [highradius.com](https://www.highradius.com/resources/Blog/trade-reconciliation/#:~:text=Trade%20reconciliation%20plays%20a%20vital,a%20loss%20of%20investors%20confidence). This project addresses these challenges by automating **trade break detection and reconciliation** in fixed-income workflows. We leverage machine learning (ML) and advanced data pipelines to detect discrepancies (“breaks”), classify their root causes, and recommend resolutions, all while maintaining a tamper-proof audit trail for compliance. A domain-adapted **DistilBERT model** has been fine-tuned on millions of historical break-resolution pairs, achieving high accuracy (≈88% micro-F1) in classifying exception root causes and suggesting fixes. We also developed a fuzzy matching micro-service using RapidFuzz to link external tickets to internal trade IDs with over 96% accuracy, and a prototype dashboard for real-time break triage and monitoring.

Key results to date include significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy. Early pilot estimates show a potential ≥60% reduction in manual reconciliation effort, which could substantially lower settlement failure rates and associated penalty fees. The solution provides real-time alerts for trade breaks, enabling faster intervention to prevent failed settlements. Importantly, the system’s design aligns with regulatory requirements: all reconciliation actions and ML-driven decisions are logged with **hash-chained, tamper-evident** records to satisfy T+1 audit trail obligations. (Regulators now expect robust record-keeping to validate compliance with the new T+1 settlement rules [capco.com](https://www.capco.com/intelligence/capco-intelligence/t-1-post-go-live-institutions-must-stay-on-their-toes#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20on%20August%206%2C,newly%20established%20SEC%20regulatory%20rules).) The project’s modular architecture (micro-services, open APIs) also facilitates integration with existing systems and positions us to extend the solution to other asset classes (equities, repos, even crypto) with minimal retraining.

In summary, the project has delivered a working suite of AI-powered reconciliation tools and prototypes that demonstrate clear value. The next steps focus on hardening these components for production (e.g. scaling the real-time pipeline, enhancing the UI, refining XML parsing) and rigorously documenting model risks for compliance. This report outlines the **project goals**, work completed in each component, data sources utilized, key deliverables, the remaining work and roadmap, as well as the expected impact and value for various stakeholders. The tone is that of a formal white-paper: we begin with objectives and context, delve into technical implementation and empirical results, and conclude with roadmap and stakeholder considerations.
