This project adheres to the **Contributor Covenant v2.1**.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and
our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age,
body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics,
gender identity and expression, education, socio‑economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best for the community and the project

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political
  attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of
acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective
action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons
for moderation decisions when appropriate.

repositories, issue trackers, pull requests, discussions, and chats—and also
applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public
spaces.

reported by contacting the maintainers at **oss‑[info@coreledger.ai](mailto:info@coreledger.ai)**.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and safety of reporters.
